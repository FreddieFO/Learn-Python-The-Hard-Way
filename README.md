Learn Python The Hard Way book
	
All my exercises from going through the Learn Python The Hard Way book.

Comments explaining concept and reasons for design choices are present through every exercise.

I made sure to go through every study drill to gain a deeper understanding and placed an emphasis on not moving on from an exercise until I understood what every piece of code did.
